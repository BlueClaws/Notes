# Maths
+ Finite and Infinite groups
+ Order a group
+ Order of element of a group (pg 31)
  - a^n
  - n.a

## Groups
+ Klien 4 group
+ Infinite abelian group 
+ General linear group
+ Special linear group


### Elementary properties of groups:
+ Unique Identity element law. 
+ Uniqueness of Inverse
+ Cancellation laws.
+ Sock-shoe property.

## Subgroup
+ Definition
+ Improper/Trivial subgroup
+ Proper/non trivial subgroup 
+ Subgroup Tests (Necessary and sufficinent conditions)
  * One-step test.
  * Two-step test. 
  * Finite test.(refer again)
  * Interesection of two subgroups is a subgroup.
  * Union of two subgroups is a subgroup (iff condifion).
  * Center of a group.
  * Normalizer of a group.
  * center of a group is always a subgroup of G.

## Cyclic groups.
+ Definition.
  * Addition
  * Multiplication.
+ Generators. 

### Cyclic subgroup.
+ definition
+ Every cyclic subgroup is an abelian group.
  - converse.
+ Inverse element is also a cyclic subgroup of G.
+ G is a group and a belongs to G:
  - If a has infinite order then a^i = a^j iff i=j.
  - If a has finite order then <a> = {e, a, a^2 ... a^(n-1)} and a^i=a^j iff n divides (i-j).
+ <a^k> = <a^gcd(n,k)>
