# Maths
+ Finite and Infinite groups
+ Order a group
+ Order of element of a group (pg 31)
  - a^n
  - n.a

## Groups
+ Klien 4 group
+ Infinite abelian group 
+ General linear group
+ Special linear group


### Elementary properties of groups:
+ Unique Identity element law. 
+ Uniqueness of Inverse
+ Cancellation laws.
+ Sock-shoe property.

## Subgroup
+ Definition
+ Improper/Trivial subgroup
+ Proper/non trivial subgroup 
+ Subgroup Tests (Necessary and sufficinent conditions)
  * One-step test.
  * Two-step test. 
  * Finite test.(refer again)
  * Interesection of two subgroups is a subgroup.
  * Union of two subgroups is a subgroup (iff condifion).
